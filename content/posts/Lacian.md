Philles is clearly not an entity, but rather a symbolic representation and a cultural construct. Its meaning is akin to that of a human name: the desire constructed by the Big Other (based on a structure of lack) constitutes the entirety of what it means to be “human,” and Philles plays a role similar to that of a “name.” This analogy can be more vividly illustrated using “nitrogen” as an example—the word “nitrogen” represents the signifier itself, whereas the “gas” component denotes the concept or meaning that the signifier refers to (the signified). Therefore, Philles is not some concrete reality; it is essentially a symbolic existence derived from cultural and signifying constructions rather than from nature or tangible matter. Its meaning is entirely dependent on the symbolic system, making it a product of construction rather than a fixed, immutable entity.

Regarding the “absence” of the Big Other, there appear to be two analytical approaches: one from the perspective of “absence” as understood in the Chinese context (absence), and the other from Lacan’s original notion of “lack,” which refers to a deficiency resulting from the inherent ruptures in language or semiotics.

First, “absence” refers to the apparent nonappearance of the Big Other in certain specific contexts. The Big Other, as an external structure (such as societal expectations), typically manifests as an omnipresent symbolic authority that does not easily “disappear.” However, in certain particular situations, this Big Other may exhibit an “absence.” For example, when the formulation of a rule directly stems from the highest authority, without support from a higher level of construction, such rules tend to serve the interests of the power institution itself rather than being based on a universal social order. In such cases, the symbolic authority of the Big Other is weakened—the “absence” here is a manifestation on a practical level, although it does not imply that the Big Other is completely non-existent. Its implicit supporting role persists, even as its symbolic legitimacy is exposed or questioned.

Second, “lack” is central to Lacan’s theory, indicating that the Big Other, as a constructed product, is inherently incomplete and perpetually bears an irreparable rupture. In this sense, the Big Other’s “absence” does not mean “nonexistence” or “loss” as might be interpreted in the Chinese context, but rather arises from its role as the core support of the symbolic order. It depends on the construction of language and signs—systems that are inherently arbitrary and limited. This inherent rupturing is an intrinsic attribute of the Big Other, rendering it forever incapable of completely encompassing the complexity of the real.

This incompleteness can be further explained through linguistics and semiotics. Different language systems have their own emphases, and certain terms in some languages may lack exact equivalents in others. For instance, some uniquely Chinese product terms are extremely difficult to render equivalently in other languages. This untranslatability exposes the limitations of language systems, further highlighting the intrinsic rupture of the Big Other as a symbolic construction. The Big Other relies on language and cultural constructs, but due to the arbitrariness of language and the diversity of cultures, this reliance is doomed never to be complete.

Finally, the lack of correspondence between the “absence” in the Chinese context and Lacan’s “lack” precisely illustrates the ruptured nature of the Big Other itself. This rupture is both irreparable and inescapable, constituting a core feature of the functioning of the symbolic order. Moreover, the correspondence between ‘애착’ in Korean and ‘依恋’ in Chinese further corroborates this notion of rupture in semiotics. In the Korean system, ‘애착’ is directly derived from Attachment Theory, with core connotations such as “the source of security,” “irreplaceability,” and “the profound pain following loss.” However, in Chinese, unless ‘依恋’ is placed within a specific context (for example, a discussion explicitly referring to Attachment Theory), its intuitive impact is greatly diminished and it tends to be understood merely as a shallow emotion or sense of attachment.
