## Theoretical analysis of power structures and rule systems

In the analytical framework of power structure, the construction and operation of the rule system presents a complex multilayered nature. Social norms can be understood as a kind of hierarchical power tool: some of the rules (e.g., the basic legal system) do have universal value and serve the stable operation of the society as a whole; while the other part of the rules are obviously instrumental with the interests of a specific class, and their core function is to strengthen the ideological control and social management system.

This dualistic character of the power structure has been fully reflected in specific social governance practices. Especially on specific topics such as epidemic control and employment restriction, the process of rule-making and implementation clearly demonstrates the essence of power operation. I believe that this is a typical manifestation of Foucault's theory of governability in real life, and at the same time, in the absence of universal rules formulated by the Big Other, the rationality of many social rules deserves in-depth exploration.

- In addition, through the study of Foucault's core ideas (the Discipline and Punish trilogy) and the Institut de France series (How to Govern the Living, etc.), I have come to believe that his theories are an effective tool for analyzing traditional institutions and for understanding the mechanisms of control in contemporary societies. Especially in analyzing the three dimensions of disciplinary techniques, punishment mechanisms and institutional construction.

## Critical Thinking in Political Economy
In the Chinese context, the relationship between business operations and political power exhibits unique complexities:

First, the traditional network of human relations occupies a central position in business operations, a phenomenon that somewhat constrains a purely capability-oriented development model. This phenomenon is particularly evident in certain regions (e.g., Shandong), in which the political and business relationship is often not a contest of intellect and power, but is reduced to a field of favors and relational operations.

Secondly, the study found that specific cultural phenomena tend to emerge in such environments, such as a drinking culture dominated by middle-aged men, and the phenomenon of the “corpse in the street”, in which competence does not match the position. These phenomena are not so much the result of business operations as they are aberrations in a particular power structure.

## Exploring the modern applicability of psychoanalytic theory

In Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, the applicability of its core concepts in the modern social context deserves in-depth consideration. Although its theory provides an important perspective in explaining the construction of the subject, it also shows obvious limitations of the times.

This limitation is mainly reflected in two aspects: first, its theoretical framework is relatively simplistic in explaining the complexity of modern society; second, some of its core concepts (e.g., the the thesis of female subjectivity - “woman does not exist”), which I speculate may have a certain element of “playfulness”, need to be re-interpreted in the contemporary context. However, the analysis of Lacanian theory on the construction of the subject, the Big Other, and the concept of Philosophy are still important references.
