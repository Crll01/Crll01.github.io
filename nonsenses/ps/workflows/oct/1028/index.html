<p>Based on certain sources:</p>
<p>I feel that Jiang Qing did have genuine feelings for Mao. As a
figure who has long been politically stereotyped&hellip; it&rsquo;s somewhat
unexpected, yet also reasonable.</p>
<p>Before 1961, Jiang Qing indeed appeared to care deeply about whether
Mao loved her—her entire mental state and social position were
profoundly tied to whether she was &ldquo;loved by Mao.&rdquo; If it were merely
a transaction, it would probably be manageable. It seems that the
fundamental driving force behind many things still has to be emotion
(😂).</p>
<p>The general picture is this: As a child, she was illegitimate, from
a chaotic family with a violent stepfather, living long-term in an
environment of humiliation and repression, which formed a typical
traumatic personality archetype. Later, she joined a drama troupe,
performed in &ldquo;A Doll&rsquo;s House,&rdquo; pursued an independent female
identity, received acclaim for her acting, cohabited with left-wing
youth, participated in associations, and then encountered—Mao , who
actually succeeded. While achieving success, he simultaneously
manipulated her psychologically. Moreover, political power itself
is—highly corrosive. Of course, there were other factors as well.
During the Cultural Revolution, she finally obtained real power and
began her frantic behavior? What she did was quite targeted. This is
one speculation.</p>
<p>Of course, in the official historical narrative project, &ldquo;women&rsquo;s
experiences of victimization&rdquo; have always been systematically erased
and concealed. To maintain the imagination of proletarian morality
and the myth of great men, within the &ldquo;proletarian narrative&rdquo; shaped
by Mao, Jiang Qing was never allowed to appear as &ldquo;an injured
woman.&rdquo; Jiang Qing had to be portrayed as a &ldquo;femme fatale,&rdquo; a
&ldquo;power-hungry lunatic,&rdquo; a &ldquo;cultural hooligan,&rdquo; rather than being
acknowledged as &ldquo;a real historical individual who suffered severe
gender humiliation and emotional devastation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All blame falls on Jiang Qing, while Mao was &ldquo;deceived in his later
years,&rdquo; thereby achieving a closed loop of legitimizing narrative.
The entire female narrative of the Mao Zedong era (and even beyond)
was accomplished through constant &ldquo;silencing&rdquo; and
&ldquo;projection&rdquo;—otherwise, how could it be framed as &ldquo;How did the most
powerful man in modern Chinese history systematically exploit/harm
women?&rdquo; That certainly wouldn&rsquo;t do. However, isn&rsquo;t this also a kind
of legacy?</p>
